# EDA and Data Viz Project - Job Application Event Dataset
## A Data Visualisation and Exploratory Data Analysis. 
 
### About the Data
Consider a system that records every instance of a job seeker applying for a job on an online portal and begins the application process. The file `job_seeker-geo.csv` consists of geographical information generated by user interaction with the system and includes the following fields:

- id: A unique identifier for each event
- created: The timestamp (in UTC) when the event occurred
- eventType: The type of event on the system
- eventValue: The event's value (in USD cents)
- jobId: A unique identifier for the job listing associated with the event
- country: The country of the job
- slug: The company name associated with the event
- geo: Geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude)

### Analyses performed
1. **State Data Enrichment**: Utilizing the State API endpoint (now expired), I added US state information to each event based on the provided latitude and longitude coordinates. This enriched dataset job_seeker-state.csv served as the foundation for subsequent analyses.
2. **Distribution of Application Events across States**: I created visualizations, including bar charts and maps, to showcase the distribution of events across different states.  These visualizations provided immediate insights into the geographical patterns of job application activities.
3. **Sum Value of Application Events across States**: Created visualizations showcasing the cumulative value of application events within each state. These visualizations effectively communicated the economic impact of job application activities across different regions
4. **Temporal Trends Analysis**: Computed and visualized moving averages of total daily event values to uncover and present temporal trends. These line plots revealed fluctuations and patterns in event values over time.

### Libraries Used
- **Numpy**: Employed for numerical computations, including moving average calculations and aggregating event values.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation, enrichment, and exploration. It facilitated the creation of data structures essential for analysis.
- **Seaborn**: Used for data visualization, aiding in the creation of visually appealing and informative charts.
- **Matplotlib**: A foundational library for data visualization, employed to generate various types of charts and graphs.
- **Geopandas**: Utilized for working with geographical data, enabling the creation of geographic visualizations.

This project allowed me to delve into the analysis of real-world job event data, enriching it with state information and generating insightful visualisations. By examining event distributions, total values, and temporal trends, I gained valuable insights into the patterns and dynamics of job application activities across different US states.
